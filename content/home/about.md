# Biography

I'm a PhD student in UC Berkeley's [probability group](https://math.berkeley.edu/research/areas/probability) and Chief Scientist of [Dascena](https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/18154552/), a startup using machine learning to [predict the onset]({{</* ref "publication/hi.md" */>}}) of life-threatening conditions. Previously, I held a [Marshall Scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Scholarship) and studied [DNA topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-quadruplex). I'm mainly interested in [interacting particle systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interacting_particle_system), [KPZ universality](http://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201603/rnoti-p230.pdf), and [line ensembles](https://math.berkeley.edu/~alanmh/papers/browniangibbs.pdf).
